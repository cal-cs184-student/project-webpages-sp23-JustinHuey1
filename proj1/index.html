<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>We implemented a rasterizer program that is able to render images from svg files. This 
  main function is accompanied by many different features implemented to either make 
  the rendered images smoother like supersampling and or make rendering them more efficient in the case of 
  level sampling. It was super interesting being able to apply the things that we learned in lecture and be able
  to visualize the impact that each of the features have on the rendering.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>The first thing that we did was just try to rasterize the triangle using all the pixels in the framebuffer. 
  We wanted to make sure that we were on the right track first before we fine tune it and limit the area 
  we sample. We did this by using a double for loop to loop through all the pixels and determine whether 
  they are in the triangle or not. We did this by creating a function that checks the point in triangle 
  test from lecture by determining whether the point passes the three line tests. We check to see if the 
  point is inside the edge for all pairs of triangle vertices. We know that a point is inside a triangle by 
  using the in line test formula from lecture and plugging in the coordinate of the pixel with the coordinate
  of the triangle's vertices and checking pairs of vertices at a time. We do this 3 times to check all 
  combinations of vertices. If the value we get from each of the formulas is either all negative or all 
  possitive, then the point is inside the triangle due to the direction of the winding. If the point passes, 
  then we fill in that pixel with the 
  given color. After making sure that we correctly rasterize the images, we can make the rasterization process 
  more effiecient by limiting the sample area to the bounding box of the triangle. This can be done by just 
  finding the minimum x and y and maximum x and y from the triangle's vertices and just looping through 
  these values. Since this area is the bounding box of the triangle, it is just as efficient as sampling 
  within the bounding box of the triangle. There were still issues with this though. It was most apparent 
  in test 2 where there were white streaks across the dragon. I was able to somewhat make it better by 
  making my loops range integers rather than floats, but there were still white dots all over. I was able 
  to fix this by adding = to my function checking if a point is in the triangle since before I was only 
  checking < and >, but it needed to be <= and >=.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>For supersampling, we are basically splitting each of the pixels into grids of the 
  sample rate that is given and then using the average color of these new pixels 
  to designate the color of the old pixel. For example, if we are given a sample rate 
  of 4, then we are splitting each of the pixels into smaller pixels of 2 by 2 squares
  and using the new 4 pixels average color to label the normal pixel that they are in. 
  We use a similar process that we did in task 1 where we then check if each of the 
  smaller pixels are within the triangle using the same line test. To loop through the new smaller pixels,
  we had to add 2 more for loops within rasterize triangle to loop through the the sample rate. 
  We kept track of each of the sample pixels in the sample buffer. After checking 
  all these new pixels, we use the value of these pixels to average the color of the 
  normal pixel. We do this by adding up the r,g,b color values for each of the new 
  pixels within a normal pixel and dividing the values by the sample rate to get the 
  average. This average color is then written into the rgb_framebuffer. The most challenging part of this was 
  making sure that I indexed into the right values for the sample buffer and make sure that the 
  corresponding values in the sample buffer position corresponded to the right frame buffer position.</p>

  <break></break>

  <p>Supersampling is useful for antialiasing and making the image look smoother by limiting the effects
    of jaggies. Instead of making a pixel
    just full on or off, we have more space to work with when we create new smaller pixels within the normal
    pixels and use it as a weight for the pixels finalized color. Without supersampling, a pixel is only colored
    if the middle is inside the triangle, but it is often the case that parts of the pixel are within the 
    triangle and not just the middle of the pixel, so supersampling helps to alleviate this issue. For 
    supersampling, we mainly had to make modifications to fill_pixel, rasterize_triangle, and 
    resolve_to_framebuffer to make them work with the new added pixels.

  </div>

  <p>As we can see in the side by side comparisons of the differing sample rates,
    as we get higher and higher sample rates for supersampling, our images become 
    smoother and smoother, especially when it comes to the edges of the shapes since supersampling
    is able to better detect whether a part of a pixel is inside the triangle or out. A higher
    sample rate will mean that our image looks better since each of the pixels will be
    divided into more smaller pixels covering the whole normal pixel. This means that
    there will be less noise when finding whether a point is within the triangle and 
    make the weight of the color more accurate.

</div>

<p>I wanted to flip the robot up side down and make it seem like it is free falling head 
  first towards the ground. I was messing around with the different types of transformations.
  For this one, I mainly used transformation and rotation to move around the robots
  body parts.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates is a coordinate system that allows us to figure out whether or 
  not a specific point is within a triangle given the coordinates of the triangle's 
  vertices and if the point is in the triangle, be able to tell the weights of each
  vertices and the influence they have on the point. Each of the weights tell us how far away the 
  point is from each of the corresponding vertices. Barycentric coordinates allow us to create
  smoother gradients within triangles.
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 4.1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Color wheel </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 4.2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Triangle with red, green, and blue colored vertices </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Looking at the right image, the triangle looks like this if there were a point in the middle of the 
  triangle that is equi distant to all 3 of the vertices so the colors are distributed
  equally. If you placed any dot within the triangle in 4.2 not in the middle, there would
  be a particular color that covers more area since there is more weight attributed to 
  that vertex. All in all, Barycentric triangles allow the interior of the triangles to 
  be smoothly covered.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Pixel sampling is matching the pixel position of the texture to the position at 
  the sample. This is often a hard issue because the sample rate of the screen and 
  texture aren't the same compared
  to the texture. This means that the sample and texture aren't aligned so it takes
  some adjustment to make the texture smooth when placed on the sample. Pixel sampling
  makes the texture more smooth and more accurate with its colors on the sample. In our function, 
  we take the input given by the user for which type of sampling to use and we process the images
  accordingly. 
</p>

<break></break>

<p>Nearest sampling, as the name suggest, takes the nearest position of the texure 
  pixel at the corresponding sample pixel position. This is really simple as we 
  just rescale the coordinates to the mipmap dimension and 
  greedily picks the closest sample pixel for each texture pixel by rounding the coordinate.
</p>

<break></break>

<p>Bilinear sampling on the other hand is much more complex. It requires taking the 
  4 nearest sample locations and getting their pixel color to use multiple linear interpolations 
  to get a more accurate pixel color. 
</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 5 bilinear 1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling 1 sample per pixel </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 5 nearest 1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling 1 sample per pixel </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 5 bilinear 16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling 16 samples per pixel </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task 5 nearest 16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling 16 samples per pixel </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>

<p>As you can see, while both sampling methods do a good job on the surface making the
  textures smooth, as you start to zoom in and magnify the texture, the bilinear sampling
  is superior. Bilinear sampling fills in more of the pixels and makes things smoother.
 </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Level sampling is used to match texture position to sample position in the hard case.
  This is the case when many texels can cantribute to pixel footprint or the shape of 
  pixel footprint is complex, meaning minification. 
  Mipmaps are good since they are efficient, require less processing power, and take less time. 
  Mipmaps have a lower resolution than the normal image and therefore less overall texture 
  data, so we can cache that data more easily.
  Level sampling allows us to dynamically change the texture and be able to have 
  lower or high resolution at a whim whenerver we want. </p>

  <break></break>

  <p>For the the get_level function. We reuse the 
    barycentric coordinate function to obtain the u and v coordinate. We can then
    use the formula from the lecture slides to compute the mipmap level. Then we use the
    sample function and based off of the inputs of the mipmap level and psm, we can
    use the corresponding functions.
  </p>

  <break></break>

  <p>For the rasterize triangle portion, we bring everything over from the rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle
    function. We have to calculate the uv barycentric coordinates of 
    (x, y), (x + 1, y), and (x, y + 1) using the barycentric formula that we used early. We then created the 
    sample parameter and input our newly created coordinates into it, which we pass the parameters into
    sample to receive our pixel color.
