    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this program, we implemented many ways to make our models more realistic looking and acting 
      in the real world. We were able to make models move according to forces and collisions. The 
      introduction of physics make the models move how we would expect them to when under forces 
      like gravity. We also implemented more efficient shaders that lower the runtime and computational 
      power necessary to render our models. One of these shaders made textures be able to 
      influence the shape of the model.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    In this part, we are creating a grid of masses connected by springs to simulate a cloth
    model. We first build the grid by adding masses. We have to create point masses and check whether 
    they are pinned. The position of the mass depends on whether our orientation is horizontal
    or vertical so we have to take that into account. The difference is that for horizontal, our 
    y value is always 1 and for vertical, we calculate a random offset to be the z value and our other 
    values are calculated accordingly based on the num_height_points, num_width_points, height, and width.
    We can then add our point mass to the point masses vector in row major order. We next have to add 
    the springs. We loop through all the point masses and determine all the types of springs between the 
    point masses.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    In this part, we are adding the physics components to the cloth model to compute how models move
    each time step when affected by forces. We first have to compute the total force acting on each 
    point mass. We use Newton's second law (F = ma) to calculate the total external force and set
    the forces for each of our point masses to be F. We then apply the spring correction forces for 
    each of the springs. We check to make sure that the spring's constraint type isn't disabled and then 
    compute the force applied to the two masses using Hooke's law. We next use verlet integration to 
    compute new point mass positions. We compute verlet integration and update the position to be what 
    we computed and also update the last_position to be our previous position. We finally constrain 
    position updates. We make sure that for each spring, the spring's lenth is at most 10% greater than 
    its rest length. Based on which point masses are pinned, we allocate the correction to the point 
    mass position accordingly.

    <break></break>
    <p>
      A small spring constant (10) creates a lot of folds near the top portion of the cloth.
      The top edge is also not as laid back as the normal cloth, there is a bigger drop. The cloth falls down at a slower
      pace. There is a bit of a swinging at the bottom of the cloth when it is reaching rest position.
      It also looks like the cloth is kind of bending inwards, which is more noticeable near 
      the bottom where there is an arc. The cloth is overall is very loose and baggy.
      A large spring constant (100000) doesn't have as noticeable of a bend at the top of the cloth.
      The cloth falls down at a faster pace. The bottom of the cloth doesn't swing as much. It comes 
      to a stop pretty quickly as soon as it reaches that position. The whole cloth just seems 
      very flat in general since the springs are much more stiff.

      A small density (5) looks similar to the large spring constant case. There is a small bend at the

    <break></break>
    <p>
      A small damping (0.02) makes the cloth move very wild for a couple of seconds. The
      swinging is very large and moves back and forth very fast. A large damping (1.0)
      makes the cloth move very slowly to its resting position. There is no swinging 
      motion, only just the cloth moving down to becoming flat. Once the cloth gets 
      to its resting position, there is very little movement.

  <p>
    In this part, we are modeling the cloth colliding with another object such as a sphere and plane.
    For spheres, we first check to see if the mass point is inside the sphere by taking the distance
    of the point mass position and origin of the sphere and checking whether this is within the radius
    of the sphere. If it is inside, then we compute the correction vector by subtracting the 
    point mass last position from the tangent point. We then update the point mass position accordingly.
    For planes, we first check whether the point mass moves from one side of the plane to the other side 
    in the last time step to see if it is inside the plane. If it is, then we compute the correction 
    vector to be (tangent - pm.last_position) * (1 - SURFACE_OFFSET). We then update the point mass 
    position accordingly.

      <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The spring constant is changing how the cloth is interacting with the sphere. With 
      the 500 k_s, the cloth is more draped over the sphere and morphs into a shape 
      that is more resembling of the sphere. There are also more folds in the cloth.
      With the 50,000 k_s, the cloth is super stiff and extending outwards rather than 
      conforming to the shape of the sphere. The only parts of the cloth that are sort 
      of bending are the points on the cloth that are directly touching the sphere. There
      are just a few folds in the cloth. The 5,000 k_s is in between the both of these
      extremes. It is mostly conforming to the shape of the sphere but still extending
      outwards a bit. The number of folds in the cloth is between both.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
  </a>

  <p>
    In this part, we are handling self-collision for the cloth model. To speed up simulation and make 
    it more efficient, we rely on implementing spatial hashing. We first need to be able to turn the 
    point mass position into a unique hash. We do this by taking the point mass position and 
    truncate its coordinate to the closest 3d box, which is done by calculating w, h, and t and creating 
    a new vector (fmod(pos.x, w), fmod(pos.y, h), fmod(pos.z, t)). Using the points of this vector, we 
    can create a unique hash for the point mass position. We then build the spatial map. This is done by 
    looping over all the point masses and adding the point mass to the right bucket in the map. Finally,
    we can implement self_collide. We loop through all the point masses that reside within the 3D volume 
    space of the given point mass. We make sure that the point we are comparing isn't the same point mass 
    given to us. We then calculate the distance between the points. If the distance is within 2 * thickness,
    then we create a correction vector that will make the point mass position 2 * thickness distance 
    apart from the compared point. We add the correction vector to an ongoing sum and take the average 
    after looping through the points. We then update the point masses position according to the 
    average and scaled down by simulation_steps.

      Density
    </p>
    <break></break>
    <p>
      The difference between the density values is most noticeable during the process of the 
      cloth falling. The smaller density has bigger waves in the way that it is falling. 
      There are also less folds overall throughout the cloth. The 
      larger density is much more linear in the way it is falling and falls pretty much 
      straight down rather than folding over itself. 
    </p>

    <break></break>
    <p>K_s</p>
    <break></break>
    <p>
      The difference between the K_s is most noticeable when the cloth is almost finished
      falling down. When there is a smaller spring constant, the cloth bounces more before 
      going to its resting position. This creates more movement and makes the cloth fold over 
      itself more when it is on the plane. The larger spring constant reaches its resting position
      quicker and doesn't move as much.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program allows us to make rendering faster and much more efficient, which is especially 
      important as we add more complex models and techniques such as lighting that would take forever
      to run on the CPU alone. The program can do this since they are running in parallel on GPU. 
      Vertex shaders usually transform vertices and modify positions and normal vectors. Fragment shaders 
      process the fragments created as a result of rasterization. They take in geometric attributes 
      which are calculated by the vertex shaders to compute the color for out_color. The output of the 
      vertex shader becomes the input for the fragment shader. In tandem, the 
      vertex and fragment shaders create the positions of the vertices and the color of the shape.

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model has an ambient light, reflection, and diffuse shading component to
      create the effects.

    <p>
      The differences between the two are pretty apparent looking at both the cloth and the sphere.
      For the bump, you can see the details on the sphere and the cloth. They looks like regular 
      textures, flat. For the displacement, the textures are more 3d like. You can see the effects of the 
      texture on the cloth and the sphere. There are ridge like features that make the models looks like 
      they have actual textures that you can feel, since the bumps seem to be extruding out of the model.

    Working with partner
We worked through all the parts together and went through them one at a time. We mainly pair programmed and bounced ideas off each other. We tried a lot of different things and explored different ideas about how to approach these questions and solve them. We learned a lot about the things we learned in lecture and were excited to apply the things we learned into a working program and be able to see how they worked.
