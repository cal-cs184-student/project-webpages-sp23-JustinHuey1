<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this assignment, we focused on how to implement different types of geometric modeling. We learned how 
    to compute and create bezier curves based off of given control points and extrapolated this idea to 
    creating 3D bezier surfaces. We then learned how to make objects look smoother. We first implemented 
    area weighted normal vectors. We then moved on to mesh upsampling. To do this step, we had to 
    implement edge flip and split, which are necessary for our loop subdivision. We combined the things 
    that we learned to implement upsampling. We could see how the subdivisions effected the edges of the 
    object and influenced the shape.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm is a way to create bezier curves from a given list of control points and a t value
    indicating where on the lines connecting the control points to add the new point after one level of the
    algorithm. Every level, there is one less point added than the previous level and the algorithm stops
    when there is only 1 point left to add. These points converge closer and closer to the curve.
    At this point, A curve can be drawn using a combinating from the start, end point, and the final point 
    added. 
</p>

<break></break>

<p>
    We first had to create a new 2D vector to store the new control points. We then loop through the control 
    points given in the argument and use linear interpolation to evaluate the new point. We then add this new 
    point to the 2D vector. The resulting 2D vector becomes the intermediate control points for the current
    level of the bezier curve.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces since we are using bezier curves that we can create using 
    the algorithm to make up the bezier surface. To evaluate the surface position given the coordinate point
    (u,v), we have to use de Casteljau to evaluate point u on each of the bezier curves that we created
    in u. These bezier curves can be used as control points to create a new bezier curve that stretches the v.
    We then have to use 1D de Casteljau to evaluate point v on the newly created bezier curve. These steps 
    allow us to evaluate the surface position corresponding to the point (u,v).
</p>

<break></break>

<p>
  We first started with the evaluate step function. This was very similar to the evaluate step that we did in task 1
  except that the points are in 3D rather than 2D, so the only difference is making the vector accept 
  3D points. We then did the evaluate1D function. This is basically used to call evaluate step multiple times
  until we get the final point after going through all the levels till the end. We just have to make sure 
  that every time we get the newly created list of intermediate control points created by the evaluate step, 
  we are passing this into the argument of evaluate step to be used in the next level. The final thing we had 
  to do is the evaluate function. We initially create an empty list. For every control point, we use the 
  evaluate 1D function and evaluate point u on these control points and add the point we get to our list. 
  Finally after evaluating at all the control points, we evaluate our total list of 3D points at point v.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We intialize a weight Vector. We used a while loop that iterates through all the faces 
    surrounding the vertex until it reaches the beginning. 
    We first check to see if the current face is on the mesh boundary. If the face is on the boundary,
    then we dont calculate the area for it and just move on to the next face. If the face isn't, 
    then we calculate the position for all 3 vertices of the triangle and find the area of the face 
    by getting the cross product of the vertices and dividing by 2, then normalizing. We then add 
    this area to the weight. This allows us to weigh its normal 
    by its area. After iterating through all the faces, we normalize the sum of all area weighted 
    normals.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.

<p>
    We drew inspiration from this web page regarding how to implement edge flips: 
    http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf.
    There are 2 phases: the collect elements phase and reassign elements phase. In the first 
    phase, we list out all our elements (halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces) and 
    create variables for everyone from halfedge1 - halfedge9, vertex0 - vertex3, 
    edge1 - edge4, and face0 - face1. In the second phase, we are reassigning all 
    the varibles that we created to reflect the edge flip operation.

<p>
    During our first attempt, the triangles where we flipped the edge would become 
    black. This required us to check to make sure that we had all the reassignments 
    correct. 
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented edge split similar to how I implemented edge flip. I went through the same steps that 
    were outlined in the website. I first collected all the elements, then allocated new elements, in particular
    several new halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces. I then reassigned all the variables to reflect the 
    edge split operation.

<p>
    When I split an edge, black appeared on one of the faces on the triangle and would create several 
    half edges inside this black face. I went through comparing the diagram that I had with my code 
    to make sure that I was matching them up right. After combing through it several times over it turned 
    out that I reassigned one of the half edges wrong.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We first started by updating the vertex positions. In step A, we computed the positions of both new and 
    old vertices using the original mesh. To compute the position of a newly added vertex, we used a 
    for loop to loop through all the edges and calculate it. Similarly to task 4 and 5, we collected the 
    elements of the mesh, but since all we need is the position of the vertices, we only had to collect 
    the half edges to get the vertices. Having the vertices positions, we can compute the position of the 
    new vertex from the equation 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D). We saved this value in the newPosition of 
    the edge, and since this edge is a part of the old mesh, we also set isNew to false. The next thing we 
    also had to do is compute the updated positions for old vertices. We used a for loop to loop through 
    all the vertices and also for each of the vertices, we had to find the sum for all neighbor positions 
    so this required another loop to iterate through all the neighbors of the vertex. After obtaining the 
    sum, we can compute the updated position using this equation 
    (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum. We saved this value in the newPosition
    of the vertex, and since this vertex is part of the old mesh, we also set isNew to false.
    After computing all the updated vertex positions, we go to step B, which is subdiving the original mesh.
    We use a for loop to loop through all the edges. We check to see if the edge is an existing edge
    and that the edge connects old vertices. If it does, we split the edge and set the 
    newPosition of this vertex to the newPosition value of the edge. We do a similar thing for flipping edges.
    We use a for loop to loop through all the edges. We check to see if the edge is a new edge and that the 
    edge connects an old vertex with a new vertex. If it does, we flip that edge. For the final step, step C,
    we have to update all vertex positions. We just loop through all the vertices and set their position to 
    be their newPosition value.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    The meshes overall become smoother, especially at the sharp corners. This is apparent in the shape of the 
    cube after just 2 subdivisions. From the beginning, we have 4 sharp 90 degree corners. After two 
    subdivisions, the cube turns into a more spherical shape where the corners and edges become more rounded
    and smooth. After another subdivision, you can barely tell that the shape started out as a cube. To 
    combat this we can pre-split the edges and this would allow us to keep the general shape of the cube.

</p>
<br>


<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.

</div>

<p>
  If we pre split the edges, then the following subdivisions make the cube more symmetric. By splitting 
  the edges, we create more faces and edges on the cube initially so the subdivisions will exponentially create more edges.
  This makes things smoother as there will be more vertices and triangles to morph the shape.
